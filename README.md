# Unit 2 Homework: Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street

## Description
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this homework assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, choose your assignment from Easy, Moderate, or Hard below.

# Hard


My solution includes everything from the moderate challenge:
Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information: 
- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

I also included the conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

My solution is also able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

# Challenge

I made the appropriate adjustments to my script that allowed it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running it once.
This can be applied to any of the difficulties.

# Other Considerations

I used the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 1 minute.


# Submission

To submit I uploaded the following to Github:


1) A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data: I decided to print the pages (one file per year) instead as a pdf file. It would be easier to check if there's any error in any of the calculations for all the tickers and all the year (Multiple_year_stock_data_NGB2*.pdf)
2) VBA Script as separate file. (HW2NEW.bas)
